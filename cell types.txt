Cell Binary Format: (int cellType, int number1, int number2, int number3, int buildingType, int affectedGroup)

cellTypes:
	Default		1. bit
	Start		2. bit
	TeleportIn	3. bit
	ReachCell	4. bit
	Increaser	5. bit

	..it can go combined like 11100 which is Increaser, ReachCell and TeleportIn
	

number1 - cell life
	0 - unvisitable
	[1, IntMax] can be visited
	-1 - immortal (can always be visited)
	
number2 - used in teleports for index of cell in 1D world cell array that it teleports player to

number3 - amount (positive or negative) that increaser adds up to its cells in affectedGroup

affectedGroup - used for increasers, index of group defined in level file

NOTES
	-if teleports don't have Default or ReachCell enabled, they can potentially make infinite loops -> enforce teleports to contain one of those
